# CardGame
Repository for my final year uni project, an online card game created using the Unity Game Engine. Gameplay in a style similar to most popular Trading Card Games, both physical (*Magic: The Gathering*, *Yu-Gi-Oh*) and virtual (*Hearthstone*).

## Running the Game
To run the game executable, simply download the Executable/Week11 folder from the repository. From here you can run the Week11.exe to run the most recent build of the game (as of 10/12/2019-21:32).

### Requirements for running the game
**System Requirements**

The following system requirements are according to the recommendations on the Unity Website [here](https://unity3d.com/unity/system-requirements)
*  Windows 7 SP1+
*  Graphics card with DX10 (shader model 4.0) capabilities.
*  CPU: SSE2 instruction set support

## Opening the Game in the Unity Editor
To open the game in the Unity Editor, you must have Unity installed. Download this repository, then when you open Unity, select "open project", and select the "ce301\_thorn\_t" folder.

### Requirements for opening the game in the Unity Editor
The Unity version used to create this game is 2018.4.10f1. It is therefore recommended that you use the same version to open the game yourself. You can download this version of the Unity Engine [here](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download?thank-you=update&download_nid=63055&os=Win).

**System Requirements**

The system requirements for opening hte game in the Unity Editor are identically to those for running the game executable.
