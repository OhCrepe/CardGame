Gold noise is annoying.
Back button on deck builder is placed wierdly.
Graphical issues with the order cards are drawn (hovered cards should appear in front).
Gamestate text is sometimes too quick or not informative enough.
Attack button and ability button aren't clear enough.
When deck is completely valid text shouldn't flash green.
Stuck on victory screen (but only sometimes).
Background needs to change.
If Illusion Frog dies while attacking with modified strength, the damage dealt is still 2.
